## Project Description
This is a mini-project (2nd project of the Ironhack data analytics course) which was created for two purposes:
1. as a practice for what we have learned on interacting with APIs and webscraping
2. to gather data for future projects in the later modules in the course (data visualization). That being said, the same repository will be used for the data visualization project as well.

The dataset, which was chosen, was solely driven by the [research questions](#research-questions). Those reseach questions revolve around stock data


## Research questions

1. Are there a best and a worst day of the months to invest in (buy stocks from) the MSCI world index and S&P 500?
2. If question one is proven to be true, will the following factors have an effect on them:
    * Time: do the best and the worst day move over the years or they stay constant.
    * Federal holidays of the year: for this project we will focus first on federal holidays of the US
    * How about corona crisis?
3. If they indeed move, by how much have they moved?
4. Will we see similar effect based on daytime?
5. As rumour has it, May and/or October might be the sour months for stock investment. Is this really true?
6. Will blue-chip stocks like Apple, Microsoft, SAP, Unilever, etc... follow the same trend, wrt worst and best day for stock purchases?
